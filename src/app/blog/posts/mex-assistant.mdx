# MEX Assistant – AI Business Assistant

**Collaboration with Grab Malaysia | UMHackathon**  
*Mar 2025 - Apr 2025*

Developed a fully functional web app for Grab's merchant-partners (MEX), enabling login and interaction with a chat-based AI assistant for real-time business insights and personalized guidance.

Integrated features like sales summaries, inventory monitoring, customer behavior analysis, and seasonal trends to support merchants in making data-driven business decisions.

Led user research and interface design, creating a multilingual platform with tailored recommendations based on business type, size, and location.
